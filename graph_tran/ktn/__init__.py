ktn: Analysis of Markovian Networks
===================================

The `ktn` package contains functions to analysize a continuous-time Markov
chain parameterized by a rate matrix :math:`\textbf{K}`, as well as estimate a
reduced Markov chain from a given community structure. The package has the
capability to interface with the graph transformation tools available in
`graph_tran/lib` as well as the external PATHSAMPLE program, which also has an
implementation of the GT algorithm in the Fortran language.
