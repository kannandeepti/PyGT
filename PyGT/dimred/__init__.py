dimred: Dimensionality Reduction of Markov Chains
=================================================

The `dimred` sub-package of `PyGT` contains functions to analysize 
a continuous-time Markov chain and  estimate a
reduced Markov chain from a given community structure. The package has the
capability to interface with the graph transformation tools available in
`PyGT.gt_tools` as well as the external PATHSAMPLE program, which also has an
implementation of the GT algorithm in the Fortran language.
